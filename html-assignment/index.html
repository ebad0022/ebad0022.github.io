                Hi there! My name is Ayah and I am currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin, this is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in college and I'm already having a great time so far! I used to be a student at Carleton university and studied Criminology/Law for a semester and a half before realizing I had no real passion for legal work and wanted to do something more creative instead. I don't have a lot of prior experience in most of my classes like photography, digital graphics, and web design, but I've always wanted to learn so I enjoy the challenge and feel proud of myself whenever I complete my work well. I'm also suprised at how easy it is to meet new people and make new friends, I am not really a social person but I'm glad I have people I can hangout with on campus. Another thing I never expected was being chosen as the class <abbr title="Representative">rep</abbr> for this semester, I just volunteered for the role last minute without thinking, but I'm glad I got chosen because I already see some things within our program that could be changed for the better and I'd love to be able to make a difference and make sure my group and I have a great 1<sup>st</sup> semester!
            </p>
